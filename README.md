# Petfood prices

## The project's description

Simple web crawler/scrapper for petfood price checking in various online petshops. The information was 
organised and then parsed into xlsx files.

### Language and Tools
Developed in python(multithreaded) using JetBrains Pycharm. 

Top libraries used:
- BeautifulSoup
- Selenium
- Pandas
- openpyxl


### DISCLAMER

***Developed solely for personal educational purposes and was not designed for any other.*** <br><br>
The project not only is not maintained, but also most probably will not work as expected, 
because it was developed a few years ago(circa 2019) and the websites used for demonstration at the time 
have changed by now.
<br>

**For that reason, no build/run guidelines will be given.**


## The project's goal 
Learn and practise small data scrapping, from http requests to page inspection and data analytics.
